The Rhino C/C++ Software Development Kit (SDK) is an API for customizing and extending Rhino for Windows. The SDK consists primarily of C++ headers and libraries that can be used to build Rhino extensions called *Plugins*. Plugins are Windows DLLs that can be loaded into the Rhino process and interact directly with the Rhino application. Rhino plugin modules use the file extension *.rhp* instead of the more common *.dll*.

The C/C++SDK provides a robust set of tools with which a developer can use to take full advanatage of Rhino. These tools provide direct access to its database structures, geometry, graphics system, and command definitions, and much more.

As with all of our development tools, the Rhino C/C++ SDK is free, royalty free, and includes free developer support.
