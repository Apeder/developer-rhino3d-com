## Overview

The openNURBS 6 toolkit reads Rhino version 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 3DM files. It writes Rhino Version 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 3DM files.

For most developers, migrating from openNURBS 5 to opennurbs 6 will involve recompiling and using new iterators to go throught the contents of an ONX_Model.
