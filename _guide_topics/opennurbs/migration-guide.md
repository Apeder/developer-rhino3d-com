## Overview

The openNURBS 6 toolkit reads all Rhino 3DM files. It writes Rhino 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 3DM files.

For most developers, migrating from openNURBS 5 to openNURBS 6 will involve recompiling and using new iterators to go throught the contents of an ONX_Model. 

## New Requirements
You must use a C++ compiler that supports C++11. Microsoft's Visual Studio 2015 or Apple's XCode 9 support C++11.
