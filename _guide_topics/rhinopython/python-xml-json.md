A few things, I typically use this to generate json from classes

[10:43]  
http://www.newtonsoft.com/json
newtonsoft.com
Json.NET - Newtonsoft
Json.NET is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET
 

scottdavidson [10:43 AM] 
Or just sudo code is fine

[10:43]  
with explaination.

luisfraguada [10:43 AM] 
so does everyone else

[10:43]  
using .net

[10:44]  
not sure if it works in IronPythin

[10:44]  
but let me show you an example

scottdavidson [10:45 AM] 
It is interesting, because there is a JSON endcoder and decoder in Python

luisfraguada [10:45 AM] 
great

[10:45]  
https://github.com/mcneel/Iris/blob/master/Iris/Objects/IrisObjectPointLight.cs

[10:45]  
here is the Iris Point Light class

[10:45]  
takes a Rhino Point Light

[10:46]  
Notice how there are things like:
`[JsonProperty("name")]
public string Name { get; private set; }`` (edited)

scottdavidson [10:46 AM] 
Yes

luisfraguada [10:46 AM] 
each of those c# class properties are 'decorated'

[10:47]  
`JsonProperty("name")`` (edited)

scottdavidson [10:47 AM] 
That is interesting.

[10:47]  
Without this library, in Python you are stuck using the Dictionary object.

luisfraguada [10:48 AM] 
https://github.com/mcneel/Iris/blob/master/Iris/Objects/IrisObjectCurve.cs

[10:48]  
this is a bit more complex...the curve class

[10:48]  
but it should take any user strings on the curve if they have them

scottdavidson [10:49 AM] 
Ok, here is a structural question.

luisfraguada [10:49 AM] 
added this C# snippet
public IrisObjectCurve(Guid geometry, Guid material, string layer) : this()
        {
            Geometry = geometry;
            Material = material;

Do you use this only to encode the string to get it out to somewhere else.

luisfraguada [10:50 AM] 
notice how in that snippet I create user data to bring layer info along

[10:50]  
anyways

[10:50]  
then

scottdavidson [10:50 AM] 
Yes

[10:50]  
So you are using JSON as a string format to write out.

luisfraguada [10:50 AM] 
https://github.com/mcneel/Iris/blob/master/Iris/IrisMain.cs#L311

scottdavidson [10:50 AM] 
Iris has there own format.

luisfraguada [10:51 AM] 
yes

scottdavidson [10:51 AM] 
OK

luisfraguada [10:51 AM] 
I go through all of the objects, convert them to all of these objects

luisfraguada [10:51 AM] 
added this C# snippet
var scene = new IrisSceneFile
            {
                Metadata = metadata,
                Geometries = m_geometry,
                Materials = m_materials,

luisfraguada [10:51 AM] 
pack it all in there

scottdavidson [10:52 AM] 
You grab certain properties off the objects and then use these tools to write out.

luisfraguada [10:52 AM] 
https://github.com/mcneel/Iris/blob/master/Iris/IrisMain.cs#L435

scottdavidson [10:52 AM] 
Perfect.

luisfraguada [10:52 AM] 
yes
