We use flow-control in Python to skip certain lines of code or to execute others more than once. We can also use flow-control to jump to different lines in our script and back again. You can add conditional statements to your code which allow you to shield off certain portions. If…Else…Else If structures are examples of conditional statements, but we'll discuss them later. A typical conditional statement is:

```
You have to be this tall (1.5m) to ride the roller coaster.
```

This line of ‘code’ uses a condition (taller than 1.5m) to evaluate whether or not you are allowed to ride the roller coaster. Conditional statements like this can be strung together indefinitely. We could add a maximum height as well, or a weight limitation, or a ban on spectacles or heart-conditions.

Instead of skipping lines we can also repeat lines. We can do this a fixed number of times:

```
Add 5 tea-spoons of cinnamon.
```

Or again use a conditional evaluation:

```
Keep adding milk until the dough is kneadable.
```
The repeating of lines is called ‘Looping’ in coding slang. There are several loop types available but they all work more or less the same. They will be covered in detail later on.
